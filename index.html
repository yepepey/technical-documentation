            <header> What is Footbal?</header>
            <p>Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees,
                kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football is understood
                to refer to whichever form of football is the most popular in the regional
                context in which the word appears. Sports commonly called football in certain
                places include association football (known as soccer in some countries); gridiron
                football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules
                football; rugby football (either rugby league or rugby union); and Gaelic football.
                [1][2] These different variations of football are known as football codes.</p>

                <p>There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball
                    games played by indigenous peoples in many different parts of the world.[3][4][5]
                     Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these
                     games at English public schools during the nineteenth century.[6][7] The expansion
                     of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British
                     influence outside the directly controlled Empire.[8] By the end of the nineteenth
                     century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for
                     example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games
                      in order to maintain their heritage.[9] In 1888, The Football League was founded
                      in England, becoming the first of many professional football competitions. During
                      the twentieth century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some
                      of the most popular team sports in the world.[10]</p>

            <header>History of Football</header>
                <p>The Ancient Greeks and Romans are known to have played many ball games, some of which involved the use of the feet. The Roman game harpastum is believed to have been adapted from a Greek team game known as "ἐπίσκυρος" (Episkyros)[17][18] or "φαινίνδα" (phaininda),[19] which is mentioned by a Greek playwright, Antiphanes (388–311 BC) and later referred to by the Christian theologian Clement of Alexandria (c. 150 – c. 215 AD). These games appear to have resembled rugby football.[20][21][22][23][24] The Roman politician Cicero (106–43 BC) describes the case of a man who was killed whilst having a shave when a ball was kicked into a barber's shop. Roman ball games already knew the air-filled ball, the follis.[25][26] Episkyros is recognised as an early form of football by FIFA.[27]</p>
                <p>There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games, played by indigenous peoples in many different parts of the world. For example, in 1586, men from a ship commanded by an English explorer named John Davis, went ashore to play a form of football with Inuit (Eskimo) people in Greenland.[28] There are later accounts of an Inuit game played on ice, called Aqsaqtuk. Each match began with two teams facing each other in parallel lines, before attempting to kick the ball through each other team's line and then at a goal. In 1610, William Strachey, a colonist at Jamestown, Virginia recorded a game played by Native Americans, called Pahsaheman.[citation needed] On the Australian continent several tribes of indigenous people played kicking and catching games with stuffed balls which have been generalised by historians as Marn Grook (Djab Wurrung for "game ball"). The earliest historical account is an anecdote from the 1878 book by Robert Brough-Smyth, The Aborigines of Victoria, in which a man called Richard Thomas is quoted as saying, in about 1841 in Victoria, Australia, that he had witnessed Aboriginal people playing the game: "Mr Thomas describes how the foremost player will drop kick a ball made from the skin of a possum and how other players leap into the air in order to catch it." Some historians have theorised that Marn Grook was one of the origins of Australian rules football.</p>

            <header>Rules</header>
            <h1>Object of the Game</h1>
            <p>The aim of football is to score more goals then your opponent in a 90 minute playing time frame. The match is split up into two halves of 45 minutes. After the first 45 minutes players will take a 15 minute rest period called half time. The second 45 minutes will resume and any time deemed fit to be added on by the referee (injury time) will be accordingly.</p>
            <h1>Players & Equipment</h1>
            <p>Each team consists of 11 players. These are made up of one goalkeeper and ten outfield players. The pitch dimensions vary from each ground but are roughly 120 yards long and 75 yards wide. On each pitch you will have a 6 yard box next to the goal mouth, an 18 yard box surrounding the 6 yard box and a centre circle. Each half of the pitch must be a mirror image of the other in terms of dimensions.
                    Essentially the equipment that is needed for a soccer match is pitch and a football. Additionally players can be found wearing studded football boots, shin pads and matching strips. The goalkeepers will additionally wear padded gloves as they are the only players allowed to handle the ball. Each team will have a designated captain.</p>
            <h1>Scoring</h1>
            <p>o score the ball must go into your opponent’s goal. The whole ball needs to be over the line for it to be a legitimate goal. A goal can be scored with any part of the body apart from the hand or arm up to the shoulder. The goal itself consists of a frame measuring 8 feet high and 8 yards wide</p>
            <h1>The Offside Rule in Football</h1>
            <p>Offside can be called when an attacking player is in front of the last defender when the pass is played through to them. The offside area is designed to discourage players from simply hanging around the opponent’s goal waiting for a pass. To be onside they must be placed behind the last defender when the ball is played to them. If the player is in front of that last defender then he is deemed to be offside and free kick to the defending team will be called.

                    A player cannot be caught offside in their own half. The goalkeeper does not count as a defender. If the ball is played backwards and the player is in front of the last defender then he is deemed to be not offside.</p>

            <header>Greatest Players</header>
            <h1>Michel Platini</h1>
            <p>France might well consider their greatest ever player to be Zinedine Zidane, but before the current Real Madrid manager had weaved his magic, Les Blues had another improbably talented playmaker - Michel Platini.

                    Credited with making France a global superpower in football, the diminutive playmaker enjoyed a long and fruitful career for both his club and country. Operating as a number 10 and an advanced playmaker, Platini often reserved his best for the biggest matches scoring a number of crucial goals in extremely important matches.

                    Winner of the Ballon d'Or trophy 3 years in a row (1983,84,85), the Frenchman reached the peak of his game when he guided the French national team to the European Championship title in 1984.

                    Scoring an incredible 9 goals in just 5 games for Les Blues in the 1984 Euros, Platini playing in his home country captured the country's imagination with his stunning performances. He was so good that even Pele could not resist complimenting him:</p>
            <h1>Ronaldo Nazario</h1>
            <p>When a player plays for Barcelona, Real Madrid, Inter Milan and AC Milan and still has no haters, you know that he is something special. Ronaldo Nazario also popularly known as 'O Fenomeno' (The Phenomenon) is probably the greatest striker to ever play the game.

                    Ever since Ronaldo burst onto the scene as a talented 17-year-old kid at Cruzeiro, there was no doubting the fact that the Brazilian forward was destined to achieve great things in the game. After taking European football by storm at PSV, Ronaldo probably had the finest season of his career at Barcelona where he cemented his legacy as one of the greatest talents this game has ever seen.

                    In fact, former Atletico Madrid and Manchester United star Quinton Fortune even said that Ronaldo was the greatest player he has ever seen:

                    "He was physical perfection, and he seemed like a mythical figure. I love [Lionel] Messi, I played many times with Cristiano [Ronaldo] and I adore him, Neymar is outstanding, Ronaldinho was exceptional—but if you put all of them together, you might get what Ronaldo was that season."
                    In 1998, Ronaldo was one of the best players in the tournament scoring 4 and assisting 3 goals, however, after suffering a convulsive fit hours before the final, he was not at his best as Brazil succumbed to host nation France in the final.

                    2002 was a totally different story. Coming back from an injury, Ronaldo took the world by storm and finished as the top scorer scoring an incredible 8 goals and winning the Golden Shoe. Calm, composed and deadly in front of goal, the legendary striker scored in all the big matches including the final leading Brazil to a truly astonishing 5th World Cup triumph.</p>
            <h1>Lionel Messi</h1>
            <p>Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi along with Cristiano Ronaldo is undoubtedly among the greatest players of our generation. Bursting onto the scene as a fresh-faced La Masia kid in 2005, Messi first under the tutelage of Frank Rijkaard and then more importantly under Pep Guardiola honed his skills and established himself as one of the greatest players to ever grace the game.

                    A child prodigy, Messi after Ronaldinho's departure quickly became Barcelona's main man and was the star in Pep Guardiola's 2008-09 all-conquering Barcelona side playing a crucial role in the incredible treble they won that season.

                    Messi's importance to the Catalan giants can be seen by Mascherano's incredible comments about his compatriot:

                    "[Messi] is indispensable, but the rest of us are dispensable. – No, the club is bigger than any manager, than any player... except Leo. That's the reality, and you have to accept it."
                    While Messi has scored in all types of important club matches - Champions League finals, semi-finals, Copa Del Rey Finals, Clasicos against Real Madrid, he somehow seems to have no luck while playing for the Argentine national team.

                    After having lost 3 consecutive finals in a heartbreaking manner with the national team, Messi even retired from the national team briefly only to come back 2 months later to have one final crack at international glory.

                    No matter what he does from now on, Messi will always be considered to be one of the greatest of all time. The only player to win the Ballon d'Or 5 times, the Argentine international who just turned 30 has started the season in blistering fashion.</p>

            <h1>Manchester United</h1>
            <p>Founded in 1878, Manchester United is the greatest English club of all time. The supporters of arch-rivals Liverpool would claim otherwise, but United’s superior consistency puts them ahead of Liverpool. United have won the European Cup/UEFA Champions League 3 times and finished runners-up on 2 more occasions. They have also won the English League title 20 times, the FA cup 12 times and the Intercontinental cup once/

                    United became a dominant football club in the 1950s under the tutelage of Matt Busby. They lost some players in the Munich air tragedy in 1958, but came back strongly from that disaster to become the leading club in England and Europe. They've had some superb players like Bobby Charlton, George Best, Denis Law and Nobby Styles and won the English league a few times before winning the European Cup in 1968.

                    United again became dominant in the late 1980s as newly appointed manager Alex Ferguson embarked on an unforgettable journey with the club. Ferguson was the helm of United for 27 years and won 13 Premier League titles and 2 Champions Leagues with them. They also won the FA cup 5 times under Ferguson.

                    United defeated Bayern 2-1 at the Camp Nou after scoring 2 goals in injury time in the 1999 Champions League final. They again defeated Chelsea to win the Champions League in 2008. United were virtually unstoppable in England throughout the major part of 1990s and 2000s with outstanding players like Ryan Giggs, Roy Keane, Cristiano Ronaldo, David Beckham, Paul Scholes and Gary Neville.</p>
            <h1>Bayern Munich</h1>
            <p>Bayern Munich, founded in 1900, are the greatest German club of all time. They also happen to be one of the European giants. They have won the Bundesliga title 28 times, the German Cup 18 times and the European Cup 5 times. They have also won the intercontinental cup on 2 occasions. The Bavarians, as Bayern are popularly known as, also enjoy avid fan following all over the world.

                    Bayern dominated German and European football in the 1970s as they won 3 consecutive European cups. Led by the incomparable Franz Beckenbauer, Bayern went to the summit of the world with players like Gerd Muller, Paul Breitner and Sepp Maier. They also won the Bundesliga 4 times in the 1970s. They again became a major force in world football during the late 1990s as Ottmar Hitzfeld became their manager and led them to European glory in 2001.

                    They also missed out on the trophy in 1999, conceding a couple of goals against Manchester United in the final in 1999. Lothar Matthaus, Stefan Effenberg, Oliver Kahn, Bixente Lizarazu and Giovane Elber formed the nucleus of that mighty Bayern side. They had a fierce rivalry with Real Madrid during the 2000s in the Champions League.

                    Bayern have won the Bundesliga 12 times since 2000 and reached consecutive UEFA Champions League finals in 2012 and 2013. They won the title in 2013 under Jupp Heynckes and boasted of players like Phillip Lahm, Arjen Robben, Franck Ribery and Thomas Muller. Bayern still remain among the strongest clubs in world football.</p>
            <h1>FC Barcelona</h1>
            <p>FC Barcelona or Blaugurana, as they are popularly known as because of their red & blue jersey, are among the most successful and passionately supported clubs in the world. They stand for the pride of Catalunya, which comes under Spain. The Catalan giants have won the European Cup on 5 occasions and the La Liga 25 times. They have also won the Spanish Cup 30 times and the Fifa Club World Cup 3 times.

                    FC Barcelona had some legendary players like Kubala and Luiz Suarez Miramontes in the 1950s, but usually played second fiddle to the mighty Real Madrid side. They were revamped and rejuvenated by their ex-player Johann Cruyff in the late 1980s and started following the “total football” model popularized by Rinus Michels.

                    Cruyff incorporated the passing game in Barcelona’s senior team as well as their football academy, La Masia. The results were immediate as the “dream team” of Barcelona won the European Cup in 1992. They made it to the Champions League final again in 1994, but lost to Fabio Capello’s Milan 0-4 in the final. Barca also won the La Liga 6 times during the 1990s. Romario, Hristo Stoichkov, Pep Guardiola and Ronald Koeman formed the core of the Barca team under Cruyff.

                    After Cruyff’s departure as a manager, Barcelona again started to be dominated by Real Madrid, who had a brilliant side in the late 1990s and early 2000s. However, Frank Rijkaard’s appointment as manager turned the tide again and Barcelona went on to win the Champions League in 2006. Pep Guardiola continued the good work and won the Champions League twice in 3 years from 2009 to 2011.

                    Barcelona again won the Champions League in 2015. Players like Lionel Messi, Xavi Fernandez, Andres Iniesta, Carles Puyol, Ronaldinho, Luiz Suarez and Neymar have made Barca the most delightful team to watch in the past decade. They have won the La Liga 9 times since 2000.</p>
            <h1>Real Madrid</h1>
                <p>Real Madrid are known as the “king of the clubs” and no other club in the world can match their success and clout. Also known as the “Los Blancos” because of their white jersey, Real have won the European Cup 13 times, La Liga 33 times, the Spanish Cup 19 times and the Intercontinental Cup on 3 occasions. It remains the ultimate dream of any footballer to wear the famous whites of Real Madrid.

                        Real’s glory days began in the 1950s, when they won 5 consecutive European cups from 1956 to 1960. Alfredo Di Stefano, Ferenc Puskas, Jose Santamaria and Raymond Kopa combined to make Real Madrid the greatest club side in the world. They also won the La Liga 7times in 9 years from  1960 to 1968.

                        Real digressed a bit in the 1970s and 1980s, but came back strongly in the late 1990s to win the Champions League thrice in 5 years from 1998 to 2002. They were known as ‘Los Galacticos” and had assembled the finest group of players ever seen in a club side. Raul, Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos and Claude Makelele made Real the greatest force in world football.

                        They again had to wait till 2014 to get the elusive 10th Champions League crown under Carlo Ancelotti. However, they again won 3 consecutive UEFA Champions League titles from 2016 to 2018 to take their tally to 13. Players like Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema, Iker Casillas, Sergio Ramos, Toni Kroos and Luka Modric made Real an unstoppable force in European football again. Real continue to be the benchmark for excellence and dominance in club football.</p>
